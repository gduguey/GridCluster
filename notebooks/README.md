In June 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau officially replaced Connecticut's 8 historical counties (like New Haven, Hartford, etc.) with 9 new county-equivalent planning regions for statistical and geographic purposes.

These planning regions now act as county-equivalent units.

They're assigned new GEOIDs starting with 91, which don't correspond to the traditional county FIPS codes like 09001 (Fairfield).
